# Notice

The component and platforms in this repository are not meant to be used by a
user, but as a "victorsmartkill" that custom component developers can build
upon, to make more awesome stuff.

HAVE FUN! ðŸ˜Ž

## Why?

This is simple, by having custom_components look (README + structure) the same
it is easier for developers to help each other and for users to start using them.

If you are a developer and you want to add things to this "victorsmartkill" that you think more
developers will have use for, please open a PR to add it :)

## How?

If you want to use all the potential and features of this victorsmartkill tempalte you
should use Visual Studio Code to develop in a container. In this container you
will have all the tools to ease your python development and a dedicated Home
Assistant core instance to run your integration. See `.devcontainer/README.md` for more information.

If you need to work on the python library in parallel of this integration
(`sampleclient` in this example) there are different options. The following one seems
easy to implement:

- Create a dedicated branch for your python library on a public git repository
- Update in the `manifest.json` file the `requirements` key to point on your development branch
- Each time you need to make a modification to your python library, push it to your
  development branch and increase the number of the python library version in `manifest.json` file
  to ensure Home Assistant update the code of the python library. (example `"requirements": ["git+https://...==0.0.1beta2"]`).

_Component to integrate with [victorsmartkill][victorsmartkill]._

**This component will set up the following platforms.**

| Platform        | Description                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `binary_sensor` | Show something `True` or `False`.   |
| `sensor`        | Show info from victorsmartkill API. |
| `switch`        | Switch something `True` or `False`. |

## Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `victorsmartkill`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/victorsmartkill/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Victor Smart Kill"

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/victorsmartkill/.translations/en.json
custom_components/victorsmartkill/.translations/nb.json
custom_components/victorsmartkill/.translations/sensor.nb.json
custom_components/victorsmartkill/__init__.py
custom_components/victorsmartkill/binary_sensor.py
custom_components/victorsmartkill/config_flow.py
custom_components/victorsmartkill/const.py
custom_components/victorsmartkill/manifest.json
custom_components/victorsmartkill/sensor.py
custom_components/victorsmartkill/switch.py
```

## Configuration is done in the UI
